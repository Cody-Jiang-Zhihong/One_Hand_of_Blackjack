# One Hand of Blackjack

## Overview
This project is a two-player (user vs computer) client-side card game, specifically a single hand of blackjack. The game is implemented with client-side JavaScript, manipulating the DOM for dynamic gameplay.

### Features
- Interactive initial screen for setting card values at the top of the deck.
- A client-side JavaScript implementation of one hand of blackjack.
- Styling for cards and gameplay interface.
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for game progress.
- "Hit" and "Stand" functionality for user gameplay.
- Automated gameplay for the computer opponent.
- Game outcome determination with display of the winner.

## Game Rules
- Each player aims to get a hand of cards closest to 21 without going over.
- Numeric values of cards determine the hand value.
- Face cards are worth 10; aces can be 1 or 11.
- The player with the hand closest to 21 wins; ties are possible.
